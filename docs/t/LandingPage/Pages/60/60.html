                    <p>Elecq Ready allows you to pre-mount the backplate for easy deployment without needing an electrician during actual use. This is the perfect choice, especially since the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) came into force, requiring pre-cabling for at least 50% of parking spaces.</p>
